# Game-of-life
Conway's Game of Life

Main rules:

    1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
    
    2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
    
    3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.
    
    
User will be able to add new live cells by clicking on the dead cells. 
User will decide when to start the simulation and when to stop it.


TO DO:
  - Create basic UI using Kivy
  - make it possible for user to place these cells
  - create start/stop button for staring the simulation
  - make them interact with enviroment(checking how many cells are around, creating a new one, make them die)
